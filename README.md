This project is an updated version of the first coding project I ever worked on in my CareerFoundry course.

Built using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Boostrap, this website is a place for me to upload links to my portfolio and projects, as well as to show off some of my work. It also includes a little information about me, a link to my professional music website, and a place for visitors to contact me by email.

It's currently hosted through Netlify, and can be found at https://felicityjames.com/
